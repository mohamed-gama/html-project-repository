  <p><b>Programming language is the language that comprises a set of instructions that produce various kinds of output. Programming languages are used in computer programming to perform algorithms. There are programmable machines that use a set of specific instructions, instead of general programming languages. The programming language like any language has its words, symbols and rules which is called syntax. There are a lot of programming languages because there are different types of programs which are wanted to be designed. There are many types of programming languages like machine language, algorithmic languages and objected-oriented languages.</b></p>
