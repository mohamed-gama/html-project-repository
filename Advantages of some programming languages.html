  <ul>
   <li><h3><u>(C++) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li>(C++) language presents the portability or platform independence which makes the user to run the same program on various operating systems easily.</li>
     <li>One of the best advantages of this language is the feature object-oriented programming which includes concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction, and encapsulation which allow the code reusability.</li>
    </ol></b>
   </li>
   
   <li><h3><u>(FORTRAN) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li>(FORTRAN) is legible and easy to understand.</li>
     <li>(FORTRAN) is like (MATLAB) but it has some mathematical processes.</li>
     <li>This language supports numerical analysis, scientific calculation, generic and structured programming.</li>
    </ol></b>
   </li>
  
   <li><h3><u>(SQL) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li>(SQL) can retrieve large amount of data rapidly and efficiently.  Processes such as Insertion, deletion and data manipulation are also done in almost no time.</li>
     <li>For data retrieval, big number of code lines is not wanted. All main keywords such as select, insert into and update are used and also the syntactical rules are not complicated in this language, which makes it the user-friendly language.</li>
