  <ul>
   <li><h3><u>Applications of (C++) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li><u>Games:</u> (C++) language overruns the complications, optimizes resource management and eases multiplayer with network.</li>
     <li><u>Web Browsers:</u> The usage of (C++) is limited for scripting of websites and web applications. However, where speed and accuracy are wanted this language is still preferred.</li>
     <li><u>Advanced Computations and Graphics:</u> (C++) language provides the means for building applications requiring real-time physical simulations, high performance image processing and mobile sensor applications.</li>
    </ol></b>
   </li>
  
   <li><h3><u>Applications of (FORTRAN) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li><u>Number Crunching:</u> (FORTRAN) is easy and efficient at processing mathematical equations because of the more natural way of expressing complicated mathematical functions and its quick execution time.</li>
     <li><u>Scientific, Mathematical, Statistical and Engineering Type Procedures:</u> (FORTRAN) language is a good choice for these applications because of its rapid number crunching ability.</li>
    </ol></b>
   </li>
   
   <li><h3><u>Applications of (SQl) language</u></h3>
    <ol><b>
     <li><u>Data Integration Scripts:</u> The major application of (SQL) is writing data integration scripts by the database developers.</li>
     <li><u>Retrieve Information:</u> (SQL) language restores the subsets of information within a database for analytics applications and transaction processing. The most used elements of this language are select, insert, update, add, delete, create, truncate and alter.</li>
